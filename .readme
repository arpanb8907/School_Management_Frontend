User A opens the chat window with User B.
Previous messages are fetched from the backend via API.
User A sends a message:

The message is sent to the backend via REST API.
The backend stores the message in the database.
The backend emits a real-time event using socket.io to User B.
User B (receiver) gets the message in real time via the socket.on("receiveMessage") event.
The new message is displayed dynamically in both users' chat windows.

=====================================================================================================

Socket is implemented ✅
sent message is stored into databse by REST API ✅
Yet to implement the fetching of older messages which will be handled by REST API ✅
